<h3>About</h3>
<p>
FCCSW is a set of software packages, tools, and standards to help different FCC studies work together.
Common software helps to avoid duplicated effort and compare results. In addition, the software
group provides infrastructure and services such as build systems, testing and continuous
integration, code format guidelines, linting and static analysis, release management and software
distribution and data persistency. This is possible due to the kind support of the EP-SFT group.

<h3> <strong> FCC software workshop and tutorial </strong> </h3>

<p>
A workshop giving an introduction to many topics has been held on 2-3 October 2019, see the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/839794/"> indico event </a>.
Software tutorials sessions will be held on 15 January 2020 as part of the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/838435"> FCC Physics week </a>.

<h3> Delphes Card Reference </h3>

<p>
  The Delphes cards used for the FCC-hh CDR and HL/HE-LHC yellow reports can be found here:

</ul>

<h3>Conceptual Design Report</h3>
The <a href="http://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/">summary volumes</a> have been released, with many
physics and detector simulations carried out in FCCSW! We collaborate with CERN's <a
href="http://www.reanahub.io/">Re-usable Analysis</a> working group to make the workflows used in
the CDR reproducible and accessible for future studies. <a href="https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-fcchh-fullsim" >Here</a> is a first example of a full-simulation
workflow.

<h3>Documentation, Tutorials and Getting Started:</h3>
<p>
All developments happen on <a href="https://github.com/HEP-FCC">github.com/HEP-FCC</a>. The best place to check
for detailed information on a specific package thus is usually its homepage / github repository page. To get an
  overview, there are some tutorials that may be helpful. Finally, there is a <a
  href="http://cern.ch/simba3/SelfSubscription.aspx?groupName=fcc-experiments-sw-dev">mailing list
  </a> for any questions
  and suggestions. For reference, the old website can be found <a href="http://hep-fcc.github.io/FCCSW/tutorials/index.html">here</a>.
